# Responsive Styles for Puck

A breakpoint-aware structured styles panel for the Puck editor. Lets users set
CSS properties (padding, color, display, etc.) per breakpoint with mobile-first
inheritance, and applies them via scoped `<style>` blocks at runtime.

## Why this exists

Puck's built-in field types (`text`, `number`, `select`, etc.) don't have any
notion of viewport or breakpoint. Each field stores a single value. That's
incompatible with responsive design, where you typically want one set of values
on mobile, another on tablet, another on desktop.

This system layers a custom Puck field on top, stores a per-breakpoint object,
and emits real CSS with media queries at render time. Tailwind utility classes
weren't a fit because Tailwind only ships classes that exist statically in the
codebase — arbitrary user-entered values can't generate new classes at runtime.

## Breakpoints

Defined in [`lib/responsive-style.ts`](../lib/responsive-style.ts):

```ts
export const BREAKPOINTS = ["base", "sm", "md", "lg", "xl", "2xl"] as const;

export const BREAKPOINT_MIN_WIDTH = {
  base: 0, sm: 640, md: 768, lg: 1024, xl: 1280, "2xl": 1536,
};
```

These mirror Tailwind's defaults. `base` is the implicit "no media query" tier
that styles everything from 0px up; the others kick in at their `min-width`.

`BREAKPOINT_PREVIEW_WIDTH` is what the canvas resizes to when you click a tab —
mostly the same as `min-width`, with `base` set to 375px so the canvas shows a
realistic phone width rather than collapsing to 0.

## Data shape

Each component now has an optional `style` prop typed as `ResponsiveStyle`:

```ts
type CSSDecl = Partial<{ paddingTop: string; color: string; display: string; ... }>;
type ResponsiveStyle = Partial<Record<Breakpoint, CSSDecl>>;
```

Concrete example stored on a component:

```ts
{
  base: { paddingTop: "16px", paddingBottom: "16px", color: "#111" },
  md:   { paddingTop: "32px" },             // wider top padding from tablet up
  lg:   { color: "#000", display: "flex" }, // tweak from laptop up
}
```

Keys that aren't present at a breakpoint are inherited from the next-smaller
breakpoint that does have them — that's the **mobile-first** part.

## Mobile-first inheritance

Implemented in `resolveAt(rs, bp)`:

```ts
// lib/responsive-style.ts
export function resolveAt(rs: ResponsiveStyle, bp: Breakpoint): CSSDecl {
  const idx = BREAKPOINTS.indexOf(bp);
  const merged: CSSDecl = {};
  for (let i = 0; i <= idx; i++) {
    Object.assign(merged, rs[BREAKPOINTS[i]] ?? {});
  }
  return merged;
}
```

Walk breakpoints in order from `base` up to and including the requested `bp`,
shallow-merging at each step. Later (larger) breakpoints overwrite earlier
ones. So `resolveAt(data, "lg")` for the example above returns:

```ts
{ paddingTop: "32px", paddingBottom: "16px", color: "#000", display: "flex" }
```

`getInheritedSource(rs, bp, prop)` answers the related question — "which
breakpoint actually supplies the value of `prop` at `bp`?" — by scanning
backwards from `bp` until it finds a breakpoint that defines that property.
This is what powers the inheritance marker UI.

## Runtime: scoped `<style>` blocks

Inline `style={{...}}` can't express media queries, so we generate a real CSS
rule per component instance, scoped by a `data-rs` attribute.

`generateCSS(rs, id)` in [`lib/responsive-style.ts`](../lib/responsive-style.ts)
emits something like:

```css
[data-rs="abc123"]{padding-top:16px;color:#111}
@media (min-width:768px){[data-rs="abc123"]{padding-top:32px}}
@media (min-width:1024px){[data-rs="abc123"]{color:#000;display:flex}}
```

Notice the mobile-first style: the `base` rule has no media query, so it
applies everywhere; larger breakpoints layer on top via cascade.

The wrapping happens in
[`lib/with-style-field.tsx`](../lib/with-style-field.tsx):

```tsx
function StyledOutput({ rs, children }) {
  const reactId = React.useId();
  const id = reactId.replace(/:/g, "");
  const css = rs ? generateCSS(rs, id) : "";

  return (
    <>
      {css ? <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: css }} /> : null}
      <div data-rs={id}>{children}</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

A few things to note:

- **`React.useId()`** gives a stable ID per mounted component, SSR-safe in
  React 18+. We strip the colons because they're invalid in CSS attribute
  selector values.
- **Wrapper vs direct mode.** By default, `StyledOutput` wraps children in
  `<div data-rs={id}>`. This is predictable but means the CSS targets the
  wrapper, not the component itself — so properties like `background-color`
  won't override a component's own background (e.g. a Button's Tailwind
  `bg-primary` class wins because it's on the inner element). For components
  that spread `...props` onto their root DOM element, you can opt into
  **direct mode** via `withStyleField(config, { applyStyleDirect: true })`.
  In direct mode, `React.cloneElement` injects `data-rs` directly onto the
  component's root element, so the generated CSS targets the component itself.
  Container components (Flex, Grid, Columns) and components that don't forward
  unknown props should keep the default wrapper.
- **The `<style>` block is co-located with the wrapper**, not hoisted to
  `<head>`. That keeps server-rendering simple and means each component's CSS
  travels with it.

## The HOF: `withStyleField`

```tsx
// lib/with-style-field.tsx
export function withStyleField(
  config: any,
  opts?: { applyStyleDirect?: boolean },
): any {
  const originalRender = config.render;
  const direct = opts?.applyStyleDirect ?? false;
  return {
    ...config,
    fields: {
      ...config.fields,
      style: {
        type: "custom",
        render: ({ value, onChange }) => (
          <StyleField value={value ?? {}} onChange={onChange} />
        ),
      },
    },
    defaultProps: { ...config.defaultProps, style: {} },
    render: (props) => {
      const { style: rs, ...rest } = props;
      return (
        <StyledOutput rs={rs} direct={direct}>
          {originalRender(rest)}
        </StyledOutput>
      );
    },
  };
}
```

It's three things in one:

1. Adds a Puck field of `type: "custom"` named `style`. Puck's custom field API
   gives us `value`/`onChange`, which we hand to the `StyleField` component.
2. Adds a sensible default of `{}` so new instances don't read undefined.
3. Replaces the render function so every render goes through `StyledOutput` and
   ends up wrapped with the `<style>` + `<div data-rs>`.

It's intentionally typed as `any` in/out. The original `ComponentConfig<P>`
generic uses a constrained `ComponentConfigParams<P>` shape that doesn't play
nicely with generic transformation, and the type story is restored at the
config level via the `StyledProps` mapped type (see below).

## Wiring it into `puck.config.tsx`

The original config object stays untouched. At the bottom of the file:

```ts
// puck.config.tsx
const rawConfig: Config<Props, RootProps, ...> = { /* unchanged */ };

type StyledProps = { [K in keyof Props]: Props[K] & { style?: ResponsiveStyle } };

const APPLY_STYLE_DIRECT = new Set(["Button"]);

const styledComponents = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(rawConfig.components).map(([name, c]) => [
    name,
    withStyleField(c as ComponentConfig<any>, {
      applyStyleDirect: APPLY_STYLE_DIRECT.has(name),
    }),
  ]),
) as Config<StyledProps, RootProps, ...>["components"];

export const config: Config<StyledProps, RootProps, ...> = {
  ...rawConfig,
  components: styledComponents,
};
```

The `StyledProps` mapped type intersects every component's existing props with
`{ style?: ResponsiveStyle }`, so the exported config remains type-safe.

## Editor UI: the StyleField

[`components/style-field/style-field.tsx`](../components/style-field/style-field.tsx)
composes everything:

1. **Viewport tabs** at the top. Clicking a tab dispatches a `setUi` action via
   `usePuck()` to resize the canvas. Resizing the canvas (via Puck's built-in
   viewport switcher in the toolbar) updates which tab reads as active. This
   is the **hybrid sync** approach — both surfaces drive the same state.

2. **Sections** declared in [`sections.ts`](../components/style-field/sections.ts):
   Spacing, Sizing, Typography, Background, Border, Layout, Effects. Each
   section is a collapsible card. Adding new properties is done declaratively
   here — no UI code changes.

3. **Per-property controls** rendered from `controls.tsx`. The five kinds:
   - `text`  — free-form value input (e.g. `16px`, `1.5rem`, `auto`)
   - `color` — native color picker + hex input
   - `select` — dropdown with predefined options
   - `number` — same as text but with a unit hint (currently unused, reserved)
   - `fourSides` — four inputs in a row for T/R/B/L (padding, margin)

4. **Inheritance marker** next to each property's label. Three states:
   - 🔵 Solid blue dot — set on the active breakpoint. Click it to reset and
     drop back to inherited.
   - ⚪️ Hollow gray dot — inherited from a smaller breakpoint. Hover for the
     source bp.
   - ⊝ Dashed empty circle — not set anywhere up to and including this bp.

   Computed via `getInheritedSource(value, activeBp, prop)` from
   `responsive-style.ts`. The marker visually communicates "are you about to
   override something, or is this property genuinely empty?"

## Hybrid viewport sync

In [`viewport-tabs.tsx`](../components/style-field/viewport-tabs.tsx):

```tsx
export function useActiveBreakpoint(): [Breakpoint, (bp: Breakpoint) => void] {
  const { appState, dispatch } = usePuck();
  const currentWidth = appState.ui.viewports.current.width;

  const bp = typeof currentWidth === "number"
    ? viewportToBreakpoint(currentWidth)
    : "base";

  const setBp = (next: Breakpoint) => {
    dispatch({
      type: "setUi",
      ui: (prev) => ({
        viewports: { ...prev.viewports, current: { ...prev.viewports.current, width: BREAKPOINT_PREVIEW_WIDTH[next] } },
      }),
    });
  };

  return [bp, setBp];
}
```

`viewportToBreakpoint(width)` returns the largest breakpoint whose `min-width`
fits — the same rule a real browser applies. So the tab the user is editing is
always the breakpoint a real visitor at that width would see.

The Puck side is configured in
[`app/puck/[...puckPath]/client.tsx`](../app/puck/%5B...puckPath%5D/client.tsx),
which feeds Puck a `viewports` array built from the same constants:

```tsx
const viewports = BREAKPOINTS.map((bp) => ({
  width: BREAKPOINT_PREVIEW_WIDTH[bp],
  height: "auto",
  label: `${BREAKPOINT_LABEL[bp]} (${bp})`,
  icon: bp === "base" || bp === "sm" ? "Smartphone"
      : bp === "md" ? "Tablet" : "Monitor",
}));
```

Same constants, two consumers — no drift.

## End-to-end: editing a value

Walking through what happens when a user types `32px` into the padding-top
input on the `md` tab:

1. `TextControl` calls `onChange("32px")` →
2. `StyleField` calls `setProp("paddingTop", "32px")` →
3. That runs `setStyleValue(value, "md", "paddingTop", "32px")` from
   `responsive-style.ts`, which returns a new `ResponsiveStyle` with the value
   merged in (or removed if `undefined`/`""`) →
4. The result is passed to Puck via the field's `onChange`, updating
   component data →
5. Component re-renders. `withStyleField` extracts `style` from props, runs
   `generateCSS(rs, id)`, and emits an updated `<style>` block →
6. The new CSS rule cascades onto the component instance via `[data-rs="..."]`
   and the user sees the change in the canvas (and on the published page).

Resetting (clicking the blue dot) follows the same path with `value=undefined`.
`setStyleValue` removes the key, and if the breakpoint becomes empty, removes
the breakpoint key too — keeping the saved data tidy.

## Extending the system

### Add a new CSS property

1. Add the camelCase key to `CSSDecl` in
   [`lib/responsive-style.ts`](../lib/responsive-style.ts).
2. Add a control entry to the appropriate section in
   [`components/style-field/sections.ts`](../components/style-field/sections.ts).

That's it. No changes elsewhere — sections drive the UI, the resolver and CSS
generator iterate over whatever keys are present.

### Add a new breakpoint

1. Append to the `BREAKPOINTS` tuple and the three lookup maps in
   `responsive-style.ts`.
2. (Optional) add a tab icon in `ICONS` inside `viewport-tabs.tsx`.
3. Existing data keeps working — older instances just don't have entries for
   the new bp, which means they inherit from a smaller bp at runtime.

### Apply styles directly to a component (no wrapper div)

For components like Button where the wrapper div prevents style manager
properties (e.g. `background-color`) from reaching the actual element, opt
into direct mode:

1. Ensure the component forwards unknown props to its root DOM element
   (i.e. uses `...props` spread).
2. Add the component name to `APPLY_STYLE_DIRECT` in `puck.config.tsx`.

In direct mode, `React.cloneElement` injects `data-rs` onto the component's
root element instead of wrapping it. The generated CSS then targets the
component itself, so style manager values can override the component's own
styles via specificity.

**Do not use this for:** container/layout components (Flex, Grid, Columns),
components that render fragments, or components that don't forward unknown
props — `cloneElement` will fail silently or break layout in those cases.

### Skip the field on a specific component

Currently the wrap is unconditional in `puck.config.tsx`. To opt out:

```ts
const SKIP = new Set(["Link", "Span"]); // names of inline components

const styledComponents = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(rawConfig.components).map(([name, c]) => [
    name,
    SKIP.has(name) ? c : withStyleField(c),
  ]),
);
```

Inline components (`Link`, `Span`) are good candidates because the wrapper div
breaks their inline-ness.

## Known limitations

- **Wrapper div changes the DOM.** By default, styled components live inside
  `<div data-rs="...">`. For most layout/box use cases this is fine. For
  components where the wrapper prevents style overrides (e.g. Button
  backgrounds), use `applyStyleDirect: true` to apply `data-rs` directly to
  the component's root element instead. For inline components or components
  whose parent expects a specific child element type, the wrapper can still
  shift behavior — consider skipping the field entirely for those.
- **Per-instance `<style>` block.** Each component instance emits its own
  `<style>` tag. There's no de-duplication. For a typical page this is
  negligible; if a page grows to hundreds of styled components this is worth
  revisiting (one shared stylesheet keyed by id would do it).
- **`!important` not supported.** Values are passed through verbatim. Add
  yourself if needed (most of the time you don't).
- **No theme tokens / variables.** Every value is a literal CSS string. A
  follow-up could let users pick from a theme palette / spacing scale.
- **`base` styles cannot be reduced at larger breakpoints in CSS terms.**
  Mobile-first means once a property is set at `base`, removing it at `md`
  doesn't unset it — it just means `md` doesn't *override* it. To "remove" a
  property at a larger breakpoint, set it explicitly to a different value
  (e.g. `display: block` at `md` to undo `display: flex` at `base`). This is
  by design and matches how CSS itself works.
